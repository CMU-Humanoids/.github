# CMU Humanoids
CMU Humanoids is a group of research labs at Carnegie Mellon University and global partners committed to advancing the development of 
humanoid robots by creating a library of open-source resources.
Our work adopts multi-disciplinary approaches to exploit the generalizability of humanoid hardware to address unsolved global problems 
such as inaccessible heathcare and workforce shortages.
