# CMU Humanoids
CMU Humanoids is a group of research labs at Carnegie Mellon University and global partners committed to advancing the development of 
humanoid robots by creating a library of open-source resources.
Our work adopts multi-disciplinary approaches to exploit the generalizability of humanoid hardware to address unsolved global problems 
such as inaccessible heathcare and workforce shortages.\
\
**Our mission is to**: \
     -Create a hub within CMU's wider science and engineering research ecostystem\
     -Advance the technological state, capabilities, and accessibility of humanoids that are able to safely and effectively operate with people in human environments\
     -Surmount key technical challenges to increased integration of humanoids into our daily lives\
\
**We consider key grand challenges to include:**\
     -**Behavior Generation and Glanning:** Enable humanoids to safely and efficiently learn to perceive and navigate human spaces\
     -**Ideation:** Enable humanoids to creatively problem solve\
     -**Care:** Enable humanoids to demonstrate empathy, earn human trust and take care of humans\
     -**Generalization and Personalization:** Enable humanoids to generalize and adapt to human needs
